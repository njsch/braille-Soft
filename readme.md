# Braille-Soft
This repository contains some of the games originally made for the Pacmate, BrailleNote and Windows PC by Louis Bryant of Braille Soft Inc., now translated into the Python programming language.

## Obtaining the Games
In order to guarantee you have obtained all the game software, ensure you have done a recursive (complete / full) git clone of everything, including submodules in other repositories where games are stored.  To do this, type the following into your terminal / shell:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tayarndt/braille-Soft.git
```

If you have not done this after already cloning, then you will have to run a `git submodule update --init` command after you cd to the directory where you stored the repository.

## Current Game Listing:
* Blackjack
* Camel
